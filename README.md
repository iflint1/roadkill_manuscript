# Roadkill manuscript Supplementary Materials

This repository reproduces our results from the Supplementary Materials of our manuscript on Roadkills in Taiwan.
The main script is `iNat.R`.
Before running the script, one needs to download the daily `radiation`, `max_temp` and `rain` from 2015-2022 on [SILO](https://www.longpaddock.qld.gov.au/silo/gridded-data/), and place the `nc` files in `data-raw/australia`.
